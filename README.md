# Predicting Students' Graduation Fields Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict students' future specialization fields based on their academic performance using Deep Neural Networks (DNN). By analyzing students' grades, the model provides insights into potential career paths, assisting students in making informed academic decisions.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Processes academic performance data to extract meaningful insights.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to predict students' specialization areas.
- **Career Guidance System**: Provides recommendations based on students' academic strengths.
- **University Integration**: Can be incorporated into university systems for automated student guidance.

## Methodology
The project follows these steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Converts categorical grades into numerical values using Label Encoding.
2. **Model Development**: Implements a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with ReLU activation in hidden layers and Softmax activation in the output layer.
3. **Training & Evaluation**: Trains the model using student academic data and evaluates its performance using accuracy metrics.
4. **Prediction**: Based on the input grades, the model predicts the most suitable specialization field for a student.

## Potential Applications
- **Career Counseling**: Assists academic advisors in guiding students toward the right career path.
- **University Systems**: Can be integrated into student information systems to provide real-time recommendations.
- **Educational Research**: Helps analyze trends in student performance and specialization choices.
